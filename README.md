# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Î¤his work demostrates the concepts I have learnt during my lectures and workshops at UniWA (department of Industrial Design Engineering). Target of this work is, after selecting a dataset of our choice, to do an exploratory data analysis. This analysis should make us understand our data set, available features, possible or even necessary feature processing tools to prepare our data set for modeling. We are using Machine Learning (ML) methods for our data in order to evaluate our model and present our findings.

Furhtermore, more specifically for our dataset, our purpose is to find valualble informations from people who suffer from CVDs in order to help them and generally people that are threaten by them.
